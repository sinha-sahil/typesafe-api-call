# Type safe API Caller

Type Safe API caller is JS Library which can be used to make RESTful API calls with `fetch` and return responses which are properly decoded into a expected response type.

## To Do

We need to add support for following:

- Examples on how to use this library
- Support for passing agent parameter in headers
- Better typing for headers & request options
- Support for hooks on API call & API Response
- Pass custom error decoder as param
- Support for auto generating type decoders for given types/interfaces
